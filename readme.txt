This is a small experiment in OpenGL using repl.it

Unfortunately due to the limitations of repl.it I am unable to get it past this stage
This will most likely not get anymore updates, feel free to try it out.

This could run on a potato TBH.

Compile with the
make
command

Use WASD to move
Use the arrow keys to look around
Use Z and X to interact with blocks
